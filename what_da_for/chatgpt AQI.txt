Once you have the AQI for each pollutant (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3), follow these steps to determine the overall air quality:

### 1. **Identify the Highest AQI**
The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) is determined by **the highest AQI value** from the individual pollutants. This is because the worst pollutant will have the most significant impact on health and is therefore the primary indicator of air quality.

For example, if you calculate the following AQIs for each pollutant:
- PM2.5: 120
- PM10: 85
- NO2: 95
- SO2: 40
- O3: 70
- CO: 60

The overall AQI will be **120** (from PM2.5), as it is the highest value.

### 2. **Determine the AQI Category**
Once you know the overall AQI, you can categorize the air quality according to standard AQI ranges. The categories provide a way to communicate the potential health impacts of the air quality.

The typical categories are:

| AQI Value | Air Quality Category       | Color   | Health Effects                                      |
|-----------|----------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 0-50      | Good                       | Green   | Air quality is satisfactory, and poses little or no risk. |
| 51-100    | Moderate                   | Yellow  | Air quality is acceptable; some pollutants may cause a moderate health concern for a very small number of people. |
| 101-150   | Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups | Orange  | Sensitive groups (e.g., children, elderly, people with respiratory conditions) may experience health effects. |
| 151-200   | Unhealthy                  | Red     | Everyone may begin to experience health effects; sensitive groups may experience more serious effects. |
| 201-300   | Very Unhealthy             | Purple  | Health alert: everyone may experience more serious health effects. |
| 301-500   | Hazardous                  | Maroon  | Health warning of emergency conditions: the entire population is likely to be affected. |

### 3. **Report the AQI and Health Recommendations**
Once you have the overall AQI and its corresponding category, you can report the air quality level and offer health recommendations based on that category.

For instance:
- If the AQI is 120 (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups), you'd advise people with respiratory issues or heart conditions to limit outdoor activities.
- If the AQI is 200 (Unhealthy), you would advise everyone to reduce outdoor activities.

### 4. **Provide Pollutant-specific Information (Optional)**
You can also offer more detailed information by showing the AQI of each pollutant. This helps the public understand which pollutant is the main contributor to the overall AQI.

For example:
- **PM2.5**: 120 (main contributor, especially dangerous for those with lung disease)
- **NO2**: 95 (elevated but not the main concern)

### Example Summary
If you calculate the following AQIs:
- PM2.5: 120
- PM10: 85
- NO2: 95
- SO2: 40
- O3: 70
- CO: 60

Your report would state:

> "The overall AQI is 120, which is 'Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups.' People with respiratory or heart conditions, children, and older adults should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. The main contributor to the current AQI is PM2.5. Ensure proper ventilation indoors and avoid outdoor exercise."

If you provide your actual pollutant data, I can help you go through this process step by step, calculating the AQI for each pollutant and determining the overall air quality.






















Yes, there are standardized formulas used to calculate air quality based on pollutants like **PM2.5**, **PM10**, **SO2**, **NO2**, **CO**, and **O3**. The most widely recognized system is the **Air Quality Index (AQI)**, which is used in many countries to convey the level of air pollution and its potential health impacts.

The **AQI** for each pollutant is typically calculated separately using a specific formula and then aggregated to get an overall AQI. Each pollutant's concentration is mapped onto a scale that defines how harmful the concentration is.

### AQI Formula for Each Pollutant
The general form of the AQI calculation for each pollutant is:

\[
\text{AQI}_p = \frac{(\text{I}_{hi} - \text{I}_{lo})}{(\text{C}_{hi} - \text{C}_{lo})} \times (\text{C}_p - \text{C}_{lo}) + \text{I}_{lo}
\]

Where:
- **AQI_p** is the AQI for pollutant \(p\),
- **C_p** is the concentration of pollutant \(p\),
- **C_lo** and **C_hi** are the breakpoint concentrations that correspond to the concentration \(C_p\),
- **I_lo** and **I_hi** are the AQI values corresponding to **C_lo** and **C_hi**.

### Pollutants and their Breakpoints
The concentration breakpoints and AQI ranges are defined by environmental agencies like the **EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)** in the US. These values vary by country, but the general approach remains consistent.

For example, here are the common breakpoint values for **PM2.5** (in µg/m³) and their corresponding AQI values:

| AQI Range   | PM2.5 Concentration (µg/m³) |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| 0 - 50      | 0.0 - 12.0                 |
| 51 - 100    | 12.1 - 35.4                |
| 101 - 150   | 35.5 - 55.4                |
| 151 - 200   | 55.5 - 150.4               |
| 201 - 300   | 150.5 - 250.4              |
| 301 - 500   | 250.5 - 500.0              |

Each pollutant (PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3) has similar breakpoints and formulas. After calculating the AQI for each pollutant, the **overall AQI** is determined as the highest AQI value among all pollutants.

### Example of AQI Calculation for PM2.5
Suppose you have a PM2.5 concentration of 40 µg/m³. You would:
1. Identify the appropriate range: 35.5 to 55.4 µg/m³ corresponds to an AQI range of 101 to 150.
2. Use the formula to interpolate:
   \[
   \text{AQI} = \frac{(150 - 101)}{(55.4 - 35.5)} \times (40 - 35.5) + 101
   \]
   This would give you the AQI value for PM2.5.

### Final AQI
After calculating the AQI for all pollutants, the **final AQI** would be the highest of the individual AQIs, reflecting the worst pollution level.
